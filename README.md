# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Time Series Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing exploratory data analysis and time series forecasting on historical stock price data. It leverages data science and machine learning techniques to analyze patterns, trends, and predict future stock prices.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Stock_price_time_series.ipynb  
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                      
â””â”€â”€ data/                          
```

## ðŸš€ Features

* Load and visualize historical stock price data
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Apply time series decomposition
* Build and evaluate forecasting models
* Generate future stock price predictions

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Statsmodels
* Scikit-learn
* Prophet (or ARIMA/SARIMA depending on notebook content)

## ðŸ“Š Sample Visualizations

* Line charts of stock prices
* Trend and seasonality decomposition
* Forecasted vs actual values

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-time-series.git
   cd stock-price-time-series
   ```

2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stock_price_time_series.ipynb
   ```

## ðŸ“¦ Datasets

You can use any publicly available historical stock price dataset (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage). Be sure to update the notebook with the path or API credentials as needed.

## ðŸ“ˆ Forecasting Models

The notebook explores LSTM's Recurrent Neural Networks for  this time series forecasting project.
